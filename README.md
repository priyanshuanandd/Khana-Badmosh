# KhanaBadmosh

A MERN stack application for food ordering and management.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/KhanaBadmosh.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd KhanaBadmosh
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The build is minified and optimized for performance.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note**: This is a one-way operation. It removes the single build dependency and copies configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) for full control.
